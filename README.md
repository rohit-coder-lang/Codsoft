CodSoft Internship Projects â€“ Python
This repository showcases the projects I developed during my internship with CodSoft, where I applied core Python concepts to create practical, real-world applications. Each project reflects hands-on problem-solving, user-focused design, and functional implementation.

ðŸ”¹ Project 1: To-Do List Application
A clean and functional To-Do List program built in Python, enabling users to add, edit, delete, and monitor daily tasks. Through this project, I gained experience in implementing CRUD operations, handling user inputs, and managing task data efficiently.

ðŸ”¹ Project 2: Scientific Calculator
An advanced calculator built with Python that performs a wide range of mathematical operations, from basic arithmetic to scientific functions. This project enhanced my understanding of mathematical logic, modular programming, and creating user-friendly command-line interfaces.

ðŸ”¹ Project 3: Password Generator
A customizable password generator that allows users to set password length and complexity. This project strengthened my skills with Python libraries such as random and string while improving my logical decision-making for better user security and experience.
